# TensorFlow Fashion MNIST
This TensorFlow sample is based on the example provided at https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification

This TensorFlow is to provide another example of how to implement a neural network for image identfication.  The mnist fashion data is used to train and test the resulting network.  A side benefit of exploring this example is that I learned more about how to use the matplotlib.pyplot class to create graphs.

From implementing this example I still need to understand how the various loss (error) functions work, as well as what an optimizer does when compiling a neural network (model).
